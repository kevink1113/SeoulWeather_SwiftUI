# SeoulWeather_SwiftUI
Simple SwiftUI weather app using OpenWeather API

You should replace "[Insert_Your_API_KEY]" (which is located in ContentView.swift line 213) with your own API key registered in https://openweathermap.org

This app was developed entirely using SwiftUI, and since this is the first SwiftUI app I developed, there may be some improvements to be made.
