# SeoulWeather_SwiftUI
Simple SwiftUI weather app using OpenWeather API

You should replace "[Insert_Your_API_KEY]" (located in ContentView.swift line 213) with your own API key registered in https://openweathermap.org

This app was developed entirely using SwiftUI, and since this is the first SwiftUI app I developed, there may be some improvements to be made.

## Features
- Current weather status
- Current temperature
- Max / min / perceived temperature
- Humidity
- Sunrise / Sunset time
- Cloud percentage

of Seoul.
